# Beer-cellar
&lt;4 hours full mern app

Full MERN Stack app developed in < 4 hours time.

Technologies used: JavaScript - ES6 - Node.js - MongoDB - Express.js - React - HTML5 & CSS3

build-setup: own boilerplate developed during the IronHack bootcamp (all my repositories have that structure).

Although it was not specified, I also used Node.js, MongoDB  & Express.js to store the user and beer information in a server-side and avoid storing all the data in the state with the front-end framework (this implies loosing all the information every time we refresh). 

My priority was to deliver the MVP + back-end (Full Mern-Stack APP) in less than 4 hours.

If I had more time:
-Fix bugs
-Upload images for user and beers with cloudinary
-Use remote api for beer data
-Improve search engine
-Improve front-end styling
-Protected routes
-Comment, notes and ratings
